The whiskers on the sides extend to the minimum and maximum values of the data set.) “What does a box plot tell you about the shape, center, and spread of a distribution?” (The median is the line in the middle, which tells you about the center. The IQR is the width of the box in the middle, which tells you about the spread. You can also tell if the distribution is roughly symmetrical.) “Why is it useful to use a dot plot and a box plot together?” (The dot plot shows the actual data values while the box plot tells the story of the data in fourths.) “How can the box plot be helpful in comparing two data sets?” (You could compare the minimum and maximum values, where the median falls, and how the data is distributed among the four quarters.)",,2025-10-09
